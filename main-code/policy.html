      <h2>How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>To provide the Services, we collect and have collected over the past 12 months personal information about you from a variety of sources, as set out below. The information that we collect and use varies depending on how you interact with us.</p>
      <p>In addition to the specific uses set out below, we may use information we collect about you to communicate with you, provide or improve the Services, comply with any applicable legal obligations, enforce any applicable terms of service, and to protect or defend the Services, our rights, and the rights of our users or others.</p>

      <h3>What Personal Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>The types of personal information we obtain about you depends on how you interact with our Site and use our Services. When we use the term "personal information", we are referring to information that identifies, relates to, describes or can be associated with you. The following sections describe the categories and specific types of personal information we collect.</p>

      <h3>Information We Collect Directly from You</h3>
      <p>Information that you directly submit to us through our Services may include:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Some features of the Services may require you to directly provide us with certain information about yourself. You may elect not to provide this information, but doing so may prevent you from using or accessing these features.</p>

      <h3>Information We Collect about Your Usage</h3>
      <p>We may also automatically collect certain information about your interaction with the Services ("Usage Data"). To do this, we may use cookies, pixels and similar technologies ("Cookies"). Usage Data may include information about how you access and use our Site and your account, including device information, browser information, information about your network connection, your IP address and other information regarding your interaction with the Services.</p>

      <h3>Information We Obtain from Third Parties</h3>
      <p>Finally, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including from vendors and service providers who may collect information on our behalf, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Companies who support our Site and Services, such as Shopify.</li>
        <li>Our payment processors, who collect payment information (e.g., bank account, credit or debit card information, billing address) to process your payment in order to fulfill your orders and provide you with products or services you have requested, in order to perform our contract with you.</li>
        <li>When you visit our Site, open or click on emails we send you, or interact with our Services or advertisements, we, or third parties we work with, may automatically collect certain information using online tracking technologies such as pixels, web beacons, software developer kits, third-party libraries, and cookies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any information we obtain from third parties will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also see the section below, Third Party Websites and Links.</p>

      <h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Providing Products and Services.</strong> We use your personal information to provide you with the Services in order to perform our contract with you, including to process your payments, fulfill your orders, to send notifications to you related to your account, purchases, returns, exchanges or other transactions, to create, maintain and otherwise manage your account, to arrange for shipping, facilitate any returns and exchanges and other features and functionalities related to your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing and Advertising.</strong> We may use your personal information for marketing and promotional purposes, such as to send marketing, advertising and promotional communications by email, text message or postal mail, and to show you advertisements for products or services. This may include using your personal information to better tailor the Services and advertising on our Site and other websites. If you are an EEA resident, the legal basis for these data processing activities is our legitimate interest in selling our products, according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention.</strong> We use your personal information to detect, investigate or take action regarding possible fraudulent, illegal or malicious activity. If you choose to use the Services and register an account, you are responsible for keeping your account credentials safe. We highly recommend that you do not share your username, password, or other access details with anyone else. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us immediately. If you are an EEA resident, the legal basis for these data processing activities is our legitimate interest in keeping our website secure for you and other customers, according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicating with You and Service Improvement.</strong> We use your personal information to provide you with customer support and improve our Services. This is in our legitimate interests in order to be responsive to you, to provide effective services to you, and to maintain our business relationship with you according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>Like many websites, we use Cookies on our Site. For specific information about the Cookies that we use related to powering our store with Shopify, see <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies">https://www.shopify.com/legal/cookies</a>. We use Cookies to power and improve our Site and our Services (including to remember your actions and preferences), to run analytics and better understand user interaction with the Services (in our legitimate interests to administer, improve and optimize the Services). We may also permit third parties and services providers to use Cookies on our Site to better tailor the services, products and advertising on our Site and other websites.</p>
      <p>Most browsers automatically accept Cookies by default, but you can choose to set your browser to remove or reject Cookies through your browser controls. Please keep in mind that removing or blocking Cookies can negatively impact your user experience and may cause some of the Services, including certain features and general functionality, to work incorrectly or no longer be available. Additionally, blocking Cookies may not completely prevent how we share information with third parties such as our advertising partners.</p>
      <p>Our website also recognizes the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal, which enables you to opt-out of certain uses or disclosures of your information. If you notify us of your preference through GPC, we will treat such signal as a valid request to opt out of sharing / targeted advertising for the associated browser or device, and, if we are able to associate the device sending the signal to a Shopify account, we will apply the opt out request to the account as well. To learn more about Global Privacy Control, you can visit <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/</a>. Other than the Global Privacy Control, we do not recognize other “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent from your web browser or device.</p>
